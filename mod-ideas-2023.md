# Deadlier Explosives

## Concealment Perk

The Concealment Perk will have to be reworked because it trivializes mines around enemy bases.  You can sprint across the mine field and none of them will explode.  Older versions of BGS games had a better balance where the mines became less sensitive or counted down slightly slower.
