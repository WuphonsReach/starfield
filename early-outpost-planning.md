# Extraction Outpost

An outpost that is designed to help you harvest resources and ship them to another outpost.

## Parts

### Extractors

- (3) Extractor - Solid
- (1) Extractor - Liquid
- (1) Extractor - Gas
- (1) Extractor - Atmospheric

### Power

You can cut this in half if you only need (3) instead of (6) extractors to start with.

- (8) Solar Array

### Storage

- (3) Storage - Solid
- (1) Storage - Liquid
- (2) Storage - Gas

### Cargo Links / Ship Pads

- (1) Cargo Link or (1) Cargo Link - Inter-System
- (1) Landing Pad - Small
- (1) Transfer Container

### Habitation

- (1) Outpost Airlock
- (1) Small Hex Hab
- (1) Bench
- (1) Bunk Bed
- (1) Storage Crate

# Planning

### Materials

A semi-comprehensive list of all the materials which you will need to build your outposts with a minimum of decoration, cargo links, beds, etc.  The more you decorate or build the more that you will need.  Or if you go barebone you will need less.

The goal of this section is to get a feel for what materials you will need in high or low volumes.

## 1st Tier Raw Materials

These are the materials for which you will want a few thousand units. At least 1000 and maybe up to 3000 units.  You will definitely want to setup an extraction outpost to harvest these.

- Aluminum `[Al]`
- Iron `[Fe]`

## 2nd Tier Raw Materials

Think "hundreds" of units in the 250-500 range.  Still worth harvesting in an automated fashion via outposts.

- Beryllium `[Be]`
- Copper `[Cu]`
- Lead `[Pb]` (commonly found near Silver `[Ag]`)
- Nickel `[Ni]`
- Sealant (flora/fauna)
- Structural (flora/fauna)
- Tungsten `[W]`

## 3rd Tier Raw Materials

Think "dozens" of units for outpost construction.  For a lot of these you'll need under 100 units with a few needing up to 200 units.

- Adhesive (flora/fauna)
- Alkanes `[HnCn]` (near Iron `[Fe]`)
- Benzene `[C6Hn]`
- Chlorine `[Cl]`
- Cosmetic (flora/fauna)
- Fiber (flora/fauna)
- Flourine `[F]`
- Lubricant (flora/fauna)
- Membrane (flora/fauna)
- Pigment (flora/fauna)
- Polymer (flora/fauna)
- Sealant (flora/fauna)
- Structural (flora/fauna)

# Systems and Planets/Moons

The focus here is on low-level systems (L1 to L5) with either Temperate/Hot/Cold climates with 1st/2nd tier materials.  It may not be possible to get all of the materials within a single outpost.  If you have unlocked harsher environments or are willing to look into higher level systems there are likely better planets and moons.

## Systems

A count of the number of bodies with Temperate/Hot/Cold climates in the Level 1 and Level 5 systems.

- (5) Cheyenne
- (2) Maheo
- (4) Narion
- (3) Sol
- (3) Alpha Centauri
- (1) Luyten's Star
- (3) Sirius
- (4) Toliman (some worlds are off-limits)
- (3) Valo
- (3) Volii
