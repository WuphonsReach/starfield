# General

- The build/modify UI can be accessed from your hand scanner.  On the PC you will press `[F]` then `[R]` to enter the outpost UI.
- If an outpost produces something and has an outbound cargo link pad configured, include the shippable resource in the outpost name.  I like to use `[Fe Ni]` for intra-system cargo links and `<Fe Ni>` for inter-system cargo linked resources.
- After placing the Outpost Beacon, takeoff in your ship to orbit and then land at the beacon.  Your ship will end up 200-500m away and it may make you reconsider your beacon placement.
- If you build your outpost over 500m (750m?) away from any landing posts and also place down the full-sized landing pad; then your ship might start landing at the outpost instead of further away.
- You will need around 500-1000 units of cargo mass in order to setup an outpost. Around 1500 cargo capacity is a comfortable level for the early game.


## Cargo Link Strategy

There is no auto-sorting object in Starfield.  That means you will have to deal with the pain of containers with mixed resources where you have to manually sort things out.  Between the cargo-link limit of three to six and the outpost limit of eight to twenty-four, you will have to frequently fiddle.

That means your inbound cargo-links should be considered temporary and changeable.  Make sure you empty out the inbound container on the cargo landing pad after removing a cargo link.


# Extraction Outpost

An outpost that is designed to help you harvest resources and ship them to another outpost.

## Parts

### Extractors

- (3) Extractor - Solid
- (1) Extractor - Liquid
- (1) Extractor - Gas
- (1) Extractor - Atmospheric

### Power

You can cut this in half if you only need (3) instead of (6) extractors to start with.  Some planets are closer to their star and the Solar Array will produce 6 units of power instead of 2-4 units.

- (8) Solar Array (needs `[XX] and [YY]`)

### Storage

- (6) Storage - Solid
- (3) Storage - Liquid
- (6) Storage - Gas

### Cargo Links / Ship Pads

- (3) Cargo Link or (3) Cargo Link - Inter-System
- (1) Landing Pad - Small
- (1) Transfer Container

### Habitation

- (1) Outpost Airlock
- (1) Small Hex Hab
- (2) Bench
- (2) Bunk Bed
- (2) Storage Crate

## Materials

The materials list includes all possible options, plus alternates. See [starfieldresourcecalculator.com](https://www.starfieldresourcecalculator.com/) if you want to do the calculations yourself.  The minimums drop some of the optional items such as the habs or extra storage.

### Extracted Solids

- (154-212) Aluminum `[Al]`
- (18-22) Beryllium `[Be]`
- (27-63) Copper `[Cu]`
- (184-204) Iron `[Fe]`
- (0-8) Lead `[Pb]`
- (13-23) Nickel `[Ni]`
- (16-41) Tungsten `[W]`

### Gases

- (3) Benzene `[C6Hn]`

### Flora/Fauna

- (0-3) Fiber
- (4) Lubricant
- (4) Membrane 
- (0-8) Sealant
- (4) Structural Material

### Components

- (15-45) Adaptive Frame
- (3) Comm Relay 
- (9) Reactive Guage 
- (6) Zero Wire

# Planning

### Materials

A semi-comprehensive list of all the materials which you will need to build your outposts with a minimum of decoration, cargo links, beds, etc.  The more you decorate or build the more that you will need.  Or if you go barebone you will need less.

The goal of this section is to get a feel for what materials you will need in high or low volumes.

## 1st Tier Raw Materials

These are the materials for which you will want a few thousand units. You will definitely want to setup an extraction outpost to harvest these along with cargo links to ship them to where you need.

- Aluminum `[Al]`
- Iron `[Fe]`
- Helium-3 `[He3]`: This gets an honorable mention because you need it as fuel for inter-system cargo links.  A base which can ship this to other planets within the system is useful.
- Nickel `[Ni]`

## 2nd Tier Raw Materials

Think "hundreds" of units in the 250-500 range.  Still worth harvesting in an automated fashion via outposts.  Maybe worth a cargo link, or ferrying a few hundred units when needed.

- Beryllium `[Be]`
- Copper `[Cu]`
- Lead `[Pb]` (commonly found near Silver `[Ag]`)
- Sealant (flora/fauna)
- Structural (flora/fauna)
- Tungsten `[W]`

## 3rd Tier Raw Materials

Think "dozens" of units for outpost construction.  For a lot of these you'll need under 100 units with a few needing up to 200 units.  It may be worth setting up an outpost and then manually ferrying a few hundred units when needed.

- Adhesive (flora/fauna)
- Alkanes `[HnCn]` (near Iron `[Fe]`)
- Benzene `[C6Hn]`
- Chlorine `[Cl]`
- Cosmetic (flora/fauna)
- Fiber (flora/fauna)
- Flourine `[F]`
- Lubricant (flora/fauna)
- Membrane (flora/fauna)
- Pigment (flora/fauna)
- Polymer (flora/fauna)
- Sealant (flora/fauna)
- Structural (flora/fauna)

# Systems and Planets/Moons

The focus here is on low-level systems (L1 to L5) with either Temperate/Hot/Cold climates with 1st/2nd tier materials.  It may not be possible to get all of the materials within a single outpost.  If you have unlocked harsher environments or are willing to look into higher level systems there are likely better planets and moons.

## Systems

A count of the number of bodies with Temperate/Hot/Cold climates in the Level 1 and Level 5 systems.

- (5) Cheyenne
- (2) Maheo
- (4) Narion
- (3) Sol
- (3) Alpha Centauri
- (1) Luyten's Star
- (3) Sirius
- (4) Toliman (some worlds are off-limits)
- (3) Valo
- (3) Volii
